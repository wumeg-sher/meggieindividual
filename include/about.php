    <p>This is a webpage developed by Meggie Wu in fulfillment of the 
        requirements of the IMM program at Sheridan College.</p>

    <p>This project came about because of a problem I had. I am a crocheter and I have a cat. 
        I also have a tendency to eject information about something from my brain as 
        soon as I do not see it. The former two parts of my problem mean that I have a lot of yarn that I
        must constantly be putting away, lest my cat eats it (which would not be good for either the cat or the yarn).
        The latter part of my problem means that I never know what yarn I have and will end up starting 
        projects that do not make use of what I have, and also buying a lot more yarn that I do not need.
        I made this webpage so that I have a place where I can see all this information at once so I don't
        lose track of my yarn and projects, and hopefully spend less money.
